								<ol class="privacy__items_item privacy-list">
									<p class="privacy__items_item privacy-item__text">
										We think our App platform is pretty nifty. Content is a great way to find out everything you need to know without the sugar-coated sales talk. Of course, to keep things honest, clean and real, it helps if we’re all singing from the same sheet. <br />
										<br />
										So, in the name of a healthy, positive platform, here are our guidelines: <br />
										<br />
										The good stuff: <br />
										<br />
										How to get the best SFERA project experience
									</p>
									<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">Be courteous. We are a diverse community of people with diverse opinions. Speaking to and about people with respect means that everyone feels free to have their say.</li>
									<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">When you see it, call it. If you see abusive content or material that violates these guidelines, report it via the "report inappropriate content". We always try to monitor content that breach our guidelines but we definitely appreciate our customers letting us know if they spot something before we do. We may temporarily disable contents where they have been reported so that our team can look into this properly.</li>
									<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">Speak the Queen’s English. Your contributions are your voice on SFERA project, so make sure those smooth, dulcet tones ring out by being as clear, descriptive and typo-free as possible.</li>
									<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">Stay safe. Be wise about the personal information you share when you’re using publicly accessible parts of the App—remember that this information may remain there indefinitely.</li>
									<ol class="privacy-list">
										The naughty stuff:
										<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">Keep the peace. SFERA project is not the place for threats, personal attacks, aggressive comments or hateful, bigoted or racist speech. We are a community of people with diverse beliefs, opinions and backgrounds, so please be respectful.</li>
										<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">Don’t talk dirty. We want to keep things clean, which means no swear words, no vulgar comments, no sexually explicit language or images and no lewd propositions. Also, please don’t write in CAPS—it may be big, but it’s not clever. Please note that if we do spot the use of CAPS these will be amended to lowercase.</li>
										<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">No spam. Any obvious advertising references found in content, comments or other content will be deleted immediately. It is not permitted to post links, HTML, provide phone numbers, email addresses or to provide information that is unrelated to the topic in order to solicit personal or financial gain. It’s also forbidden to send bulk messages or submit any other unauthorised content with the purpose of promoting your business or product.</li>
										<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">
											Keeping it legal. We don’t want to call in the boys in blue, so make sure you don’t break the law by:
											<ul class="privacy-list">
												The naughty stuff:
												<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">submitting fake content or paying someone to submit content that benefits your business</li>
												<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">copying other people’s content without permission or proper attribution—please be aware of copyright laws</li>
												<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">scamming people into sharing personal information</li>
												<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">stealing or borrowing anything from SFERA project or other sites (like copyright or trademark material)</li>
												<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">breaking or hacking into private unauthorised places, especially if it’s with the intention of causing harm or stealing information</li>
												<li class="privacy-list__item privacy-item__text">threatening, defaming, making libellous statements, harassing, invading people’s privacy or impersonating others.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p class="privacy__items_item privacy-item__text">
										We are committed to doing everything we can to protect SFERA project from fake content. On the rare occasion that we do find bogus content, spam, fake news or submissions from fraudulent profiles, we remove them immediately and take steps to ensure that the businesses and users in question are penalised in our rankings on SFERA project.
										<br />
										<br />When we have to step in:
										<br />
										<br />SFERA project reserves the right to edit or remove content that we determine to be inappropriate and/or in violation of these Content Guidelines or other terms of use.
										<br />
										<br />Please be aware that, depending on the level of offence, violating the Content Guidelines may result in the termination of your SFERA project account without warning.
										<br />
										<br />If your content is reported to the Review Team for breach, they may (a) temporarily disable the access to content or (b) remove its content while they investigate. If they determine that the content does breach our Content Guidlines, they may elect to remove the content in its entirety. The Review Team will always reinstate the content re-submit a content which conforms with these Guidelines.
										<br />
										<br />Serious allegations & Police Investigations
										<br />
										<br />Thankfully, it is rare that any serious allegations are made on SFERA project, but in the very unfortunate event that criminal activity, police investigations, or serious allegations are made against, please report to us, so that we can help in any way that we can and can give the issue all the attention that it needs.
										<br />
										<br />These content guidelines were written with the best interests of the SFERA project community in mind. If you have any additional suggestions on how to improve them, or any other feedback.
