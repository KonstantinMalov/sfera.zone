                    SFERA builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, and grow businesses. These Terms govern your use of SFERA, services, technologies, and software we offer, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by SFERA Project, Inc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don’t charge you to use SFERA or the other products and services covered by these Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your settings at any time to review the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.

                <h2>1. The services we provide </h2>
                <p>
                    SFERA’s mission is to help people around the world come together and get closer to each other, develop and deal effectively with personal issues, (work, business and hobby). To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you: 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Provide a personalized experience for you:
                </h3>
				<p>
					Your experience on SFERA is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, and other content you see in News Feed or our video platform to the SFERA  Pages you follow and other features you might use, and search. We use the data we have - for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize your experience.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Connect you with people and organizations you care about:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across the SFERA  Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you and others - for example, groups to join,or send a message to, or people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people are connected to people they care about. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    There are many ways to express yourself on SFERA and to communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the SFERA  Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several people, creating groups, or adding content to your profile. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Combat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    People will only support SFERA Products if they feel safe. If we learn about harmful behavior of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that people can use SFERA Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    We engage in research to develop, test, and improve SFERA Products. This includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our <a href="/legal/data_policy.html">Data Policy</a> explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving SFERA services.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different SFERA Products that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on SFERA to make it easier for you to connect with them, and we enable you to communicate.

                    We want people to use SFERA Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so): 
                </p>
                <p>
                   1. You may not use SFERA Products to do or share anything:

                    <li>

                <p>
                    3. You may not access or collect data from SFERA Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.

                <p>
                    If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

                    To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies. You can submit a complaint by following the link next to the content.
                </p>
                <p>

            <div>
                <h2>3. The permissions you give us</h2>
                <p>
                    We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
                </p>

                <p>
                    1. <a href="#">Permission to use content you create and share:</a>Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws. 
You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on SFERA  Products you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. 
However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above. 
Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with SFERA Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content. This means, for example, that if you share a photo on SFERA, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems. 
You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users, however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where: 
</p>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        immediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);
    </li>
    <li>
        your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    </li>
    <li>
        where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to: 
        <ul type="square">
            <li>
                investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of SFERA);
            </li>
            <li>
                comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
            </li>
            <li>
                comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency; 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    2. in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis). 
    In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content has been fully deleted.    
</p>
<p>
    3. <a href="#">Permission to update software you use or download:</a> If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.
</p>
<h3>4. Limits on using our intellectual property</h3>
<p>
    If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in SFERA Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on SFERA ), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or trademarks ( or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.

                <h2>4. Additional provisions </h2>
                <h3>1. Updating our Terms</h3>
                <p>
                    We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make SFERA Products better for you. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope that you will continue using SFERA Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the SFERA, you can delete  your account at any time.
                </p>  
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>2. Account suspension or termination</h3>
                <p>
                    We want SFERA  to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular SFERA, we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>3. Limits on liability</h3>
                <p>
                    We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the SFERA Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                <h3>4. Disputes</h3>
                <p>
                    We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the SFERA Products.
                </p>
            </div>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and SFERA Project, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.
                    </li>
